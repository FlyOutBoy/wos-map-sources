# Existing UI architecture

## Owners and integration boundaries

| Source | Responsibility / data |
|---|---|
| WOS_Start/WoS_Hero_Icons_Init.j (`heroicon`) | Existing ten-player HeroIcons, train/round scores/timers, camera slider, player statistics, Discord. `Hero[]`, Team1Round/Team2Round/TrainKill/CurrentRound. `UpdateStatusHeroSlotOptimized`, `PlayerStatusHeroPeriodic`, manual initialization from map start. |
| WOS_Start/DefaultArmorChangeStable_Copy.j (`HeroUnitPanelStats`) | Existing selected unit overlay now compact icon/stats/vitals/gold HUD. `GetHpRegen`, `GetMpRegen`, `GetPhysRes`, `GetMagRes`, Avul/base exception. Native damage text context 0; local visibility guard. |
| WOS_Start/ShowCD.j (`AllyHeroAbilityUI`) | Command-slot mapping QWERTFG, genuine origin commands for own selected unit, presentation overlays/tooltips for other units; enemies never expose cooldown. `AHUI_GetOriginSlot`, `AHUI_UpdateOriginState`, `AHUI_Periodic`. |
| WOS_Start/WoS_Pick_Init.j (`AAINIT`) | Actual category/page/hero preview/confirm/random/ban/repick/swap UI; normal/captain/draft bindings; map-start initialization. |
| WOS_Start/WoS_Shop_Init.j | Actual shop tabs/search, recipes/craft, auto-buy, inventory; existing input/event handlers. |
| WOS_Start/Scoreboard.j (`WosScoreboard`) | Graphite style reference; team/player stats, saved hero records; requires heroicon. |
| WOS_Start/Starts.j | TestMode and mode dialog, combat/system setup; test help/ShopInfo texttags. |
| WOS_Start/TeamMapPings.j | Physical Z and synced ally pings, target snapshots, minimap projection, no fog modifiers. Local wheel/mute state. |
| WOS_Start/ChatCommand.j | Emoji palette, local enable/disable; frame toggles and sync commands. |
| WOS_Start/EMOTES.j | Existing emote frame and commands; keyboard K handled by Systems/ButtonPressed.j. |
| WOS_Start/Player_Pick_Mode.j, Captain_Draft.j | Mode-specific selection/vote interfaces and handlers. |
| WOS_Start/UI_CAREER.j, MusicPlayer.j, UniversalTooltips.j | Career UI/music controls/shared tooltips. |
| Systems/Systems2.j, TasBox.j | Hero ability/counter bars, charge box library; some SIMPLEFRAME children under native Console. |
| Heroes/*.j | Hero-specific state bars; retain mechanics and refresh paths, migrate normal FRAME parents only. |

Paths above are relative to `triggers/`. Generated exhaustive inventory will be
saved as FRAME_INVENTORY.md; inspect only affected files in subsequent sessions.

## Root constraints

- FRAME and SIMPLEFRAME have separate hierarchies. Native command/inventory
  SIMPLEFRAME parents must not be rebound to a normal leaderboard FRAME.
- Create/get frame handles synchronously; first-time native lookups inside a
  GetLocalPlayer block can cause different handle allocation across clients.
- A hidden parent hides descendants. A service leaderboard root must stay visible;
  hide its title/backdrop, not the root itself. New normal FRAME root lives there.
- Keep GameUI visible. Preserve stock command/item handlers and system menus.
- Avoid BlzHideOriginFrames(true) until each required stock surface is accounted for.
- Reforged moving commands/items uses named CommandButton_N / InventoryButton_N;
  keep origin handles for existing data/overlay mappings.

## Validation boundary

## Implemented layout contract (compiled, not game verified)

- WOSUI.j normal root independent of Console. All roots created synchronously.
- Native command/item SIMPLEFRAME tree retained; items share command parent.
- Seven slots [8,9,10,11,7,5,6], centers X=0.354+slot*0.040, Y=0.044, size=0.036.
- Native slots 0..4 are in Orders/Learn drawer; ordinary unit fallback shows 12.
- Minimap corners (0.004,0.004)..(0.144,0.144); portrait (0.176,0.051), stats
  directly right (0.200..0.310), vitals center (0.474,0.093/0.079), items 3×2
  X=0.630/0.655/0.680, Y=0.060/0.035; gold center (0.742,0.091).
- Top portrait subtree is separately hideable; scores/train remain on original root.
- Test help only shown by original TestComm when TestMode is enabled.

### Validation boundary

Native JassHelper/pjass and production-handler tests are available. No native
Warcraft UI automation is available; visual, actual item drag, menu modal behavior,
resolution changes and live multiplayer must be recorded as unverified until played.
